        According to the survey and the analysis of the place we got to know that the climate at this place is very harsh during the monsoon and all the farming and the other things are depended on the way the weather changes .
        The village has all other basic facilities other than hospital and problems like unemployment faced by the peoples.<br/></br>
        The people here are happy with the kind of lifestyle there are living and enjoying in the way it is event through they have to face some problem for the same.
        They wish to follow and continue the culture and lifestyle with no cange in there. According, to the people  they are satisfied with all that they have, but only thing they wish to have is medical facilities and some help to grow tourism  there,
        The major problem faced by the people is unemployment and to leave the town town for employment and education.as per our observation the young generation is mostly  out of village for years for employment purpose and visit their home town only in vacation for few days.so to overcome this situation there should be growth into tourism which will provide job facilities to many villagers in terms of transport, hotels, restaurants, etc. An other facilities which will help to provide services for visitors.
        As sugarcane is cultivated in this region people may start their own small cottage industry for jaggery production as it doesnât required much of capital. Womens are willing to start their small scale production of pickle and other household products which will also fascinates tourists to buy this organic products.
        As said earlier this place is totally dependent on climate and major occupation of the region is agriculture.
